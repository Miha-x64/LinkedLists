A sample app written using MVVM architecture
with databinding within Kotlin code.

Using:
* [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/Kotlin/)
* [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) to fetch data via HTTP
* `android.util.JsonReader` to parse JSON
* [Splitties Views DSL](https://github.com/LouisCAD/Splitties/tree/master/modules/views-dsl) for building UI with Kotlin code
* [Lychee](http://github.com/Miha-x64/Lychee/) for data binding, both UI and JSON-to-struct
